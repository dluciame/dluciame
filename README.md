These include the **Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)**, which validates my ability to design, build, configure, and manage Kubernetes clusters. I am also certified in **Terraform**, demonstrating my expertise in infrastructure as code (IaC) concepts and best practices. Additionally, I possess the **AZ-104 Microsoft Azure Administrator** certification, confirming my proficiency in managing cloud services that span storage, security, networking, and compute capabilities within Microsoft Azure.

## 🚀 About Me

I thrive in fast-paced environments that push me to learn and grow. Staying on top of the latest tech trends is my jam, and I’m always on the lookout for new tools and methods to make DevOps even better. 🛠️

I’m also big on sharing knowledge and helping others. Whether it’s through blog posts, talks, or open-source contributions, I love being part of the tech community. My goal is to use my skills to create scalable, secure cloud solutions that make a real impact. 🌐

When I’m not working, you’ll find me tinkering with new tech, contributing to community projects, or just exploring the latest in DevOps and cloud engineering. Always up for a chat about the latest trends or a cool new project! 😄

In my free time, I enjoy climbing and hiking. There’s nothing like reaching new heights and exploring the great outdoors to keep life balanced and exciting. 🧗‍♂️🌲
